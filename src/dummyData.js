Armed with placards bearing all manner of protest inscriptions, the half-clad women moved on major roads in the state bearing placards with inscriptions like, ‘Stop the conspiracy against our people’; ‘INEC should reverse the declaration now’; ‘Our Vote must count; Ombugadu won’; “We Didn’t Vote For You” over and over as they marched around Lafia capital city of Nasarawa State. “We did not vote for Governor Sule, we voted for David Ombugadu, he is the person we want. INEC should check the results and let the will of the people stand,” one of the protesting women said. Prior to this protest, the Nasarawa State Police Command sent out a statement informing the general public that all forms of protest have been banned throughout the state. The Nasarawa police spokesman, Abdulrahman Nansel, said in the statement on Sunday said: “[A]ll proposed protests under any guise are hereby prohibited.” The undaunted women, who protested topless however said they did not vote for Abdullahi Sule of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the governor of Nasarawa for a second term. They accused him of rigging himself into power and forcing himself on them. After March 18 governorship election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Governor Sule winner. Following the announcement of the election results, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the APC of conspiring with officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agents to manipulate and alter the governorship election results in the state. The party alleged that the stolen results were taken to various locations including the Government House and the Federal University, Lafia, where APC agents altered and manipulated the figures in favour of the party. The State Returning Officer for the governorship election, Professor Tanko Ishaya, declared that Governor Sule of the APC polled 347,209 votes, to beat his closest rival, David Ombugadu of the PDP, who had 283,016 votes.",
