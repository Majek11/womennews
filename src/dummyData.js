          "A petition alleging marginalization of women, injustice and imbalance in judicial appointments in Plateau State has reached the table of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Hon. Justice Olukayode Ariwoola.The petition filed by a public policy analyst, Sesugh Akume, on Friday alleged that there is injustice and imbalance in the appointment of judges for the Plateau State High Court. Sesugh in the statement he signed and made available to journalists in Abuja, said female judges were marginalized in the recent appointment made by the National Judicial Council (NJC) for the High Court in Plateau.According to him, the NJC had within the month, announced the “recommendation of its interview committee to appoint five (5) judges of the High Court in Plateau, as follows: i. Charles Donlong ii. Ashashabu Suleiman Wase iii. Shikamma Kassam Shittu iv. Mary Abah Izam v. Nanle Titus Komak. “It was observed that of the five persons only the fourth on the list, Mary Abah Izam, is female, indicating twenty percent (20%) female representation. “It should be recalled, however, that the National Gender Policy (NGP) 2006, mandates public institutions in Nigeria to reserve thirty five percent (35%) of all positions exclusively for women. “I, therefore, respectfully brought to his lordship’s attention that the NJC’s interview committee’s recommendation not being in consonance with the letter and spirit of this national policy, presents the perception of the continued discrimination against women in judicial appointments up to this day and age. “Also that, especially, the NJC, the apex and regulatory body which is of the judiciary to be seen as going against a national policy which seeks to create balance, and a fairer society, but rather be seen as increasing inequality and/or being indifferent to discrimination against women should not be encouraged. “I, therefore, urged his lordship, as chairman of the NJC, to use your good offices to correct this historic injustice and set the pace for the judiciary in Nigeria to reflect more gender balance, now and always, beginning with this latest recommendation for appointment in the Plateau state judiciary”.",

I can also do other repairs as well.Those who were discouraging me are now bringing their phones for repairs,” said Falmata."

Armed with placards bearing all manner of protest inscriptions, the half-clad women moved on major roads in the state bearing placards with inscriptions like, ‘Stop the conspiracy against our people’; ‘INEC should reverse the declaration now’; ‘Our Vote must count; Ombugadu won’; “We Didn’t Vote For You” over and over as they marched around Lafia capital city of Nasarawa State. “We did not vote for Governor Sule, we voted for David Ombugadu, he is the person we want. INEC should check the results and let the will of the people stand,” one of the protesting women said. Prior to this protest, the Nasarawa State Police Command sent out a statement informing the general public that all forms of protest have been banned throughout the state. The Nasarawa police spokesman, Abdulrahman Nansel, said in the statement on Sunday said: “[A]ll proposed protests under any guise are hereby prohibited.” The undaunted women, who protested topless however said they did not vote for Abdullahi Sule of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the governor of Nasarawa for a second term. They accused him of rigging himself into power and forcing himself on them. After March 18 governorship election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Governor Sule winner. Following the announcement of the election results, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the APC of conspiring with officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agents to manipulate and alter the governorship election results in the state. The party alleged that the stolen results were taken to various locations including the Government House and the Federal University, Lafia, where APC agents altered and manipulated the figures in favour of the party. The State Returning Officer for the governorship election, Professor Tanko Ishaya, declared that Governor Sule of the APC polled 347,209 votes, to beat his closest rival, David Ombugadu of the PDP, who had 283,016 votes.",

Though findings have shown that men are as responsible for infertility as women, women are often treated as being the cause of the issue and many have been subjected to harsh treatment from their spouses. Tunde Ajaja in his Travails of the childless wife… published by PUNCH on 23 July 2016 told a story: “In the company of her only son, Ms. Funmilola, 37, walked the length of the recreation park before settling into one of the benches at the extreme. With her dark sunglasses on, she tried as much as possible to seclude herself from the merrymaking that had rented the atmosphere. It was a public holiday, and understandably, many fun seekers, comprising women, men, and children had trooped into the park to have a good time. They all seemed to be having fun, except the single mother of one who sat quietly, cuddling the boy, whom she had recently adopted. The three-year-old munched the biscuit in his hands in a guileless manner as if there was nothing in sight to worry about. Funmilola has virtually become a recluse following the painful experience she had in her marriage of 11 years before her husband finally sent her packing, simply because she could not conceive…” It is a familiar story for many women in Nigeria and one can only imagine what it was like for Chidinma Amaechi before providence smiled on her. After nine years of being unable to conceive a child, the Amaechis certainly never expected five children in one single birth but that was what happened. It was a rain of three boys and two girls at a go! 28-year-old, Chidinma Amaechi gave birth to the quintuplets through a caesarian section on Thursday night at Awka, the Anambra State capital. Mrs. Amaechi, who finished her National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) in July 2022, is married to an Onitsha-based small-time trader, Tochukwu Amaechi. The couple has called on the government, Nigerians, and other well-meaning individuals to assist them offset the over N7.5 million hospital bill. Speaking to journalists at the hospital, the woman’s elder sister, Ebele Oranekwu, said the bill for the incubators is N250,000 per day. She disclosed that the babies, who are currently in the intensive care unit of the hospital, are expected to be there for about 30 days. “This bill amounted to about N7.5 million aside from other huge bills already accumulated in the past two months of managing the delicate pregnancy at the hospital. “We are therefore calling on philanthropists, governments, and non-governmental organisations to come to our aid to enable us to offset the huge medical bills so we can reap the full benefits of God’s blessings upon our family,” Oranekwu said.",
