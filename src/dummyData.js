I can also do other repairs as well.Those who were discouraging me are now bringing their phones for repairs,” said Falmata."

While seeking for help for their dyslexic son, Felicia along with her husband Pastor Ben Arikpo, in the year 2013 co-founded the dyslexia foundation. The Foundation was formally established in 2015 with the vision that no one should be left behind in education on account of a learning challenge especially dyslexia. They also set out on a mission to create awareness as well as provide training and remediation on learning disorders including advocacy for policy and legal changes with respect to people living with learning challenges (especially dyslexia) in Nigeria. In the eight years of amazing impact and gaining new perspectives with her team, the dyslexia foundation has created awareness on dyslexia in various schools in Lagos, Abuja, Calabar and Port Harcourt, educating well over five million people on the signs and symptoms of dyslexia through the use of various mass media. Before 2015 very few people and schools in Nigeria had proper Knowledge of dyslexia. Children who are living with dyslexia suffered a lot from family members, school teachers and school mates. They are seen as lazy and not working hard enough. They are called and described in derogatory terms and made to feel small.
